5. **AI Intelligence** - Answers questions and helps with tasks
6. **Persistent Window** - Stays open for ongoing use

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If the app doesn't start:
```powershell
python test.py
```

### If hotkey doesn't work:
- Make sure no other app uses `Ctrl+Alt+A`
- Try running as Administrator

### If you see a blank window:
- The app is working! Press `Ctrl+Alt+A` to activate
- The window only appears when you use the hotkey

### If API key issues:
- Use demo mode: `python ai_assistant.py`
- Or set API key: `$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"`
